# Analysis of trends in Layoffs using SQL
**Goal:** The goal of this project is to analyze layoff data using SQL to surface insights on layoff trends and patterns within different industries for a dataset containing layoff data from 2020 to early 2023. The analysis aims to uncover insights like most affected sectors, time period with highest layoff rates and other key insights.

## Data Cleaning
**Description:** To ensure accurate analysis, data cleaning was performed. Steps for data cleaning included removing duplicate entries, standarizing data formats, handling null values and removing unwanted columns.

**Skills:** Data Manipulation, Data Validation

**Tools:** MySQL

## Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
**Description:** The EDA explored key trends in the dataset, such as identifying heavily impacted sectors and analyzing the timing of layoffs.

**Skills:** Joins, CTE(Common Table Expressions), Subqueries, Window Functions, Aggregate Functions

**Tools:** MySQL

## Conclusion
This SQL project analyzed global layoff trends from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 to early 2023, focusing on data manipulation and analysis using MySQL. By leveraging techniques such as joins, window functions, and aggregate queries, valuable insights were drawn from the dataset.

The analysis revealed that numerous companies with significant funding faced layoffs, particularly in the tech sector, which experienced the highest number of layoffs during this period. Notably, the United States recorded the most substantial layoffs in 2022, with post-IPO companies showing a marked increase in layoffs as they adjusted to market realities. These findings underscore the impact of economic fluctuations and the need for adaptive strategies within affected sectors.
